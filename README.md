# Market-Segmentation

In this elbow method the x-axis represents the number of clusters and the y-axis represents the sum of squared errors which measures the variance within each cluster

Before the elbow (1 to 3 clusters): The SSE decreases significantly indicating that adding more clusters greatly reduces the variance within cluster
After the elbow (5 or more clusters): The SSE decreases more gradually so adding more clusters does not significantly improve the clustering results

The elbow is at 4 clusters which indicates that using 4 clusters will balance the trade-off between variance within clusters and the number of clusters
